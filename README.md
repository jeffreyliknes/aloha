Project Aloha

Project Aloha is a demonstration on how to visually mimic a simple website using HTML and CSS. Aloha is a one paged fashion website that uses a variety of styles to cater to any audience.

Using Visual Studio Code, the website Aloha CSS to manage and place HTMl efficiently.

Aloha is structured with different fonts by using external CSS code from cites like Flickity and Fontawesome. Other aspects of the website like the carousel and "sign-up" form were created using external code and Javascript.

To achieve proper border properties, an external "reset" code from https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ was used, and placed in a seperate file in the project folder.

GitIgnore file was made in order to remove any useless system files connected to the project.
