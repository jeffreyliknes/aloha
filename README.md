Project Aloha

About:
    Project Aloha is a demonstration on how to visually mimic a simple website using HTML and CSS. Aloha is a one paged fashion website that uses a variety of styles to cater to any audience.

Technologies Used:
    - Visual Studio Code 
    - CSS
    - Javascript (JQuery)
    
    External websites were used to for the carousel and fonts, Flickity and Transfonter respectively. FontAwesome was also used for various icons.
    
    To achieve proper border properties, an external "reset" code from https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ was used, and placed in a seperate file in the project folder.

    GitIgnore file was made in order to remove any useless system files connected to the project.

Learnings:
    As this was my first project at RED Academy, the use of CSS and flexbox was new to me.
